### Completed Components
- [x] **Authentication System**
  - Login page with email/password validation
  - Registration page with display name and password strength requirements
  - Session persistence with remember me functionality
  - Auth middleware for route protection
  - Guest middleware for redirecting authenticated users

- [x] **Dashboard & Navigation**
  - Dashboard with welcome content and feature overview
  - Persistent header with responsive mobile menu

  - Inline task editing with save/cancel
  - Task completion toggling
  - Soft delete with 7-day recovery window
  - Task restoration from deleted state

  - Empty states for no tasks

- [x] **State Management**
  - Pinia stores for auth and tasks
  - Auto-refresh on focus for real-time updates
  - Optimistic UI updates with error recovery
  - Explicit imports required (no auto-imports for stores)

- [x] **Testing Infrastructure**
  - Unit tests with Vitest (26 passing tests)
  - E2E tests with Playwright (34 passing tests)
